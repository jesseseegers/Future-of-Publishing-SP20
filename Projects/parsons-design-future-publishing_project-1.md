### Project 1: Medium Translation & Augmentation

In this project, we will be reviving a literary work, whose copyright is now recently in the public domain, from relative obscurity by taking the content as an as-found publication from a previous era, and injecting new life into it by (1) adding contemporary content to frame the original within today's context, (2) re-designing the form for a screen-native experience, and (3) providing a new *context* for the publication to surface it's ideas and delivery mechanism (i.e. content and form) within today's media ecosystem by either generating derivative samples or framing the form in another media ecosystem.



- Using a literary work in the public domain (see [Are.na channel resources](https://www.are.na/jesse-seegers/public-domain-harv2p3hkcw)) translate and augment the inherited content by designing a publication for a new edition in a digital format
  - Consider: Illustrations, interactivity, audience, time (!), how interactivity and time relate to one another
  - Content of the work must be tied to the translation and the augmentation must be related in some way to both the content and the form
  - Augmentation examples:
    - images (from public domain)
    - form elements (questionnaire, fill in blank)
    - media embeds (related posts from other media platforms (Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Google Maps, etc.)
    - textual, from other sources, i.e. footnotes, annotation, marginalia
- Content Ideas:
    - Short Stories/Chapters from novels
    - Poems
    - Articles from periodicals
    - Film (script!)
    - a journal article or academic paper
    - newspaper article
    - recipe
    - Example: [The Art of Making Whiskey by Anthony Boucherie](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21592)
        - Contains 15 chapters of instructions, but no illustrations
        - Find images in the public domain (or create your own) to augment the original work
        - For Example, is there a Youtube video you can find frames from/make animated GIFS from
- Technical components
    - find the work and wrangle formatting into contemporary best practice (Markdown .md file with media/assets linked)
    - decide on digital edition screen size (desktop or mobile or ????? (watch)) or responsive
    - Design Mockups using a wireframing/prototyping/design application, or with code/visual editor
    - **You *MUST* add an Editor's Note:** the circumstances you found the work in (original, already digitized/OCR'd?) what you've done to the work, how you've accomplished this and why (reasons could vary from the practical to the conceptual/poetic)
- Schedule:
    - Week 3: Announce & Introduce Project
    - Week 4: Present chosen work and proposed content augmentation
    - Week 6: 1st Draft Group Pin-Up
    - Week 7: Draft 2 peer-to-peer review
    - Week 8: Final file/link due (midterm)
