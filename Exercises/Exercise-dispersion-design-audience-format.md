## Exercise: Dispersion -- Design, Audience, Format

Using Seth Price's *Dispersion* as your given content, re-design the publication for a new, digital, format and a completely different audience. The purposes of this exercise are: (1) to start to develop workflows for screen-native outputs, using Markdown to format texts, (2) test aesthetic choices and sensibilities to reflect the audience you have in mind, and (3) get experimental with the potential of content to change forms to suit an intended audience.



In this exercise, think about the following:

- Finding (or building) your audience

  - Describe it in a few sentences
  - Consider how typography and composition can signal who the intended audience is
  - Yes, this is quick, which tells you that this exercise should be quick and dirty, rather than precious and bespoke
- Testing and developing a robust workflow that you could eventually output to multiple formats or media - even though for this exercise you are only required to make a single format - using markdown and text editors to
- How the final output format may necessitate changes to the content

**Deliverables:**

- Final possible output formats include (but are not limited to):

   Digital Formats:
  - web:
    - tumblr
    - cargo
    - glitch
    - personal website page
    - Medium
    - URL/site (does not have to be online, just a prototype)
  - file
    - PDF
    - html & css
    - EPUB (either fixed format or re-flowable)
  - platform
    - Instagram
    - Twitter
    - Tik Tok?
