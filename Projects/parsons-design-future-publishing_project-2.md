### Project 2: Post-Artifact (digital/screen) Publication Design & Dispersion↔Post-Artifact Artifact

Find a born-digital web-native publication and bring it into a physical format as a means of preserving it for after the (imaginary?) media apocalypse.



- Identify a native-digital publication (construed in the broadest possible sense) experience which
- Create a physical artifact publication output from the born-digital publication, considering:
  - To what extent is the visual character of each similar or different?
  - What is lost? Either through media-specific limitations or intentional choice
  - To what extent are the distribution mechanisms similar or different? Make a diagram distilling means of distribution similarity/difference
  - Parsing video or audio content
- Content Ideas:
  - A Website that hasn't been used/updated in a long time (an out-of-commission blog, for example)
    - e.g. History of the World timeline (long scroll bar navigation)
  - Audio/Visual content - how do you archive in a physical form
    - Open transcripts (look up)
    - what can you do with a transcript that you can't do with the video
  - add an analytical layer?
- Technical Components:
  - Design using the program/tool of your choice
  - Use a digital-native workflow to output a print-native artifact
- Schedule
  - Week 9, March 27: Introduce Project
  - Week 11, April 10: Draft 1: peer-to-peer review in small groups
    - Make one full-size mockup of your thing, a sketch. It can be hand-made and hand-sketched on regular copy paper, but it should be real enough for you to project your ideas onto it and think about what decisions are already made and which ones still need to be made. If it’s something digital, make a rough sketch using Google Slides to show what your prototype is going to look like. Or you can use digital prototyping tools to make a sketch (pop is particularly good for making prototypes out of hand sketches, Figma is also good for prototyping). Bring it into class and use it as a visual aid to explain what you will be making for the next few weeks. Have a plan. Think about how long it takes to get something printed, or to print it out yourself, and work that into your plan. 
  - Week 13, April 24: Draft 2: group critique
  - Week 15, May 8: Final review with guest critics (final class)
