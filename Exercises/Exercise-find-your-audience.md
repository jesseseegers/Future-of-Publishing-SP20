### **Find/build your audience**

- Assemble in groups of three
- Identify the creators of a product of contemporary publishing that you would like to research further
  - Research their influences in the creation of that publication - either through interviews, deductive or speculative reasoning
  - For example:
    - If you like the Gentlewoman, look at Gert Jonkers and Jop van Bennekom and their influences
    - If you like 032c, you could say Joerg and Maria Koch, Mike Meire or Mirko Borsche, and look at what influenced them in the 90s (Kunstforum, Peter Saville )
- Then identify a historical publication **from more than 20 years ago** (book, magazine, other) that has influenced *who you are influenced by*
- Write a paragraph about who you think the audience for the original publication is. Some questions you might answer include:
  - Who is the intended audience for the
    - Who is *not* the intended audience?
  - How is the audience of the original similar or different from the publication it influenced today?
  - Have any technologies changed the look and feel of the publication?
  - Can you identify design tropes that are derivative, homage, or in conversation between the contemporary and historical examples?
- Include images to help illustrate your research


For example:
  - Selected publication is The Gentlewoman, founded by Gert Jonkers and Jop van Bennekom, now edited by Penny Martin
    - The audience is for an affluent, fashion-interested, North American and European audience in their mid-20s to early-40s
    - fashion stylists, designers, photographers, magazine enthusiasts
    - The Gentlewoman is a magazine about taste: Restraint is one of its tenets; another is respect.
  - A magazine that influenced the direction
    - British Vogue in the 1980's under the editoship of Anna Wintour
    - at the time, the magazine was “deeply unfashionable,” the “absolute apotheosis of neoconservative image-making.”
    - “I wouldn’t say that our politics or our image-makers or even our tastes are the same,” - Martin
