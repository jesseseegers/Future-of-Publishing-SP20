## Project 2, Draft 1 Guidelines



- Prepare a presentation of five ideas for your final project. Use google slides or a similar presentation tool and share your presentation with me so that we can easily go through them.
- Create the presentation as follows:

  - Slide 1: The question you are asking. It could be helpful if the question starts with “how might we” or “what are some unexplored ways to.” It could be more abstract, like “how might we rethink the relationship of author and reader?” Or it could be more concrete, like “what are some unexplored ways to explain to a low literacy person how to vote?”

  - Slide 2-9: on each slide, note an idea, the content, the form, and the audience. You can do this in words or in a combination of sketches, diagrams, and/or words.

* This will be easier if you keep something the same, such as the content or the form. So, for example, your content could be the constitution, and you could think through different ways to concretize and disseminate it. Or your form could be an algorithmically served ad, and you could think of ways to subvert the form for a different purpose.
* Some ideas for coming up with ideas you haven’t already thought of:
  * A) Look at your mind map/are.na references/earlier research and find relationships between keywords you haven’t thought of putting together yet, that are far apart from each other on the map.
  * B) Cross what you are thinking about with some of the core concepts and dilemmas we’ve been reading about and discussing, such as the reader using multiple platforms, corporate/algorithmic control of the distribution of books, not knowing what is true and what isn’t, etc.
  * C) Think about conditions that don’t exist yet, but are possible futures. So you could consider a future where commutes are longer, or where everyone’s identity online is known, or where everything is tracked and censored.



You will develop one of these ideas into a final project. The purpose of this project is to apply all steps of the design process - research, ideation, prototyping, iteration, and presentation - towards a conceptual project.

In order for it to work this way, the following must be true, everything else is up to you:

* The project should demonstrate, frame, or respond to a dilemma about publishing that was either discussed in class or sparked from the readings.
* You should take into account what you can do, and slightly aim outside or above what you think you can do. Carefully decide each aspect: what is the scale, the form, the hierarchy, the color, etc. Do not use any defaults, assuming that the nice engineers at Adobe or on an online platform know more than you do. Think about distribution and time in addition to any visual or physical artifacts.
* The content should be preexisting. If you spend time writing or transcribing, you will not have enough time to focus on the design of the project.
* Your project does not have to be useful or marketable. It just needs to demonstrate an idea about publishing. That idea could have something subversive about how you manipulate money, but being profitable is not a goal for this project. Your idea should not be a business plan. Do that after school.
* You should have a specific audience in mind for the project. (Not “adult women 25-55” - this is not a marketing class.) Think through what your audience knows and values, and how you want to change their thinking.
